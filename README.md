Ocampo-Esta Corporation Workspace Software

Program Description:
    This program was made to assist operations within the company workspace. The primary features include Project Organization, Project Tracking, Document Filing, Timesheet and Payroll Allocation, and Work Assistance Tools.

Motivation:
    After seeing how the company has barely embrased the new digital era, We created this program to help improve efficency and productivity. It was also the first step of my personal goal to make the office more ecofriendly by replacing the scattered papers that overcluttered the office
    with a shiny new digital system. 

Build Status:
    The software is currently in its Alpha Stage. There will be updates in the near future regarding bug fixes, UI improvements, and new feature implementations. 

Installation:
    No installation is required. The program exists as an executable file and can only operate within the company's network.
